        <p><strong>Febuary</strong> 19th, 2021 around 11:25 a.m. a beautiful baby girl<br> 
            was born to first time parents.The first glance into her tiny<br>
            barely open eyes we fell in love.Now it was time to take her<br> 
            home for the first time!As first time parents we were scared<br>
            but prepared as much as we could be! The nurses finally <br>
            released us and rolled my wife out while she was holding<br>
            our little girl. We put the car seat in and headed home<br>
            for our adventure to begin!
