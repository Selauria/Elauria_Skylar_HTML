    <h2>There is more to eat other than milk?</h2>
    <p>Now she is trying all sorts of new puree foods.<br>
        Different kinds of veggies such as spinach, sweet potato and carrots.<br>
        And yes she loves them!<br>
        As far as fruits go she has had all of them and loves them as well!

    <h2>A faster way of travel!</h2>
    <p>It started with a simple roll over on to her tummy.<br>
        Then she sat up and looked at us with a gleem in her eye.<br>
        Followed shortly after that she learned to slowly hold herself up and CRAWL!<br>
        She took off but then she stopped, sat up and looked at us with a curious face.<br>
        She reached out for our hands, grabbed our fingers and stood straight up!<br>
        Now she crawls to an edge and climbs up to stand on her own two feet.
